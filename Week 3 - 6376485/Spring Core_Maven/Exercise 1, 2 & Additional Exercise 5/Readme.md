# Spring Core – Exercises 1, 2 & 5

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- **Exercise 1**: Set up a basic Maven-based Spring project using XML-based configuration.
- **Exercise 2**: Demonstrate Dependency Injection (DI) using setter-based injection and XML bean definitions.
- **Exercise 5**: Repeat and reinforce concepts from Exercise 1 and 2. *(Same implementation and logic as Exercises 1 & 2.)*

## 🗂️ Directory Overview

- `LibraryManagement/` – Complete Spring Core Maven project.
- `Code/` – Java source files only for easier review.
- `Output/` – Screenshot showing successful console output.

---

## 📄 Key Files

- `applicationContext.xml` – Spring bean configuration file (XML-based).
- `BookService.java`, `BookRepository.java` – Classes demonstrating DI using setter injection.
- `LibraryManagementApplication.java` – Main class to bootstrap Spring context and test bean wiring.
- `pom.xml` – Lists required Spring dependencies for Spring Core.
- `Output.png` – Screenshot of console output verifying application success.

## 🔁 Exercise 5 Note

> ✅ **Exercise 5 is identical to Exercises 1 and 2.**  
> It reuses the same files and structure, intended as a recap or practice of XML configuration and setter-based DI in Spring.

## ✅ Output

- Spring ApplicationContext loads successfully via XML configuration.
- Bean dependencies are correctly injected using setter methods.
- Output confirms that service and repository layers are connected as expected.
